# Safety Event Pipeline

## Overview

The safety event pipeline defines how the agent detects, classifies, escalates, and resolves safety‑related events during execution. Safety events include harmful content, policy violations, unsafe tool usage, invalid LLM outputs, memory safety breaches, and planner failures. The pipeline ensures that safety issues are intercepted early, handled deterministically, and resolved without exposing unsafe content to the user.

The pipeline operates across all subsystems: LLM, planner, tools, memory, and orchestration.

## Safety Event Types

### Content Safety Events
Triggered when:
- user input contains harmful or disallowed content,
- LLM output violates safety rules,
- unsafe memory is retrieved.

### Tool Safety Events
Triggered when:
- tool arguments are unsafe,
- tool output contains harmful content,
- tool execution attempts restricted operations.

### Planner Safety Events
Triggered when:
- planner generates invalid or unsafe plans,
- recursive or looping plans are detected,
- unsafe tool sequences are proposed.

### System Safety Events
Triggered when:
- internal errors occur,
- corrupted state is detected,
- memory safety validation fails.

## Detection Mechanisms

### Rule-Based Detection
Static rules identify:
- disallowed content,
- unsafe tool parameters,
- invalid schemas,
- prohibited operations.

### Schema Validation
Ensures:
- LLM outputs follow required schemas,
- tool calls match input definitions,
- planner steps are structurally valid.

### Safety Filters
Applied to:
- memory retrieval,
- LLM outputs,
- tool results.

### Behavioral Heuristics
Detect:
- repeated unsafe attempts,
- suspicious tool patterns,
- anomalous planner behavior.

## Safety Event Pipeline Flow

### 1. Event Detection
Any subsystem may raise a safety event:
- LLM output validator,
- tool registry,
- planner,
- memory safety layer.

### 2. Event Classification
The event is categorized as:
- content safety,
- tool safety,
- planner safety,
- system safety.

### 3. Severity Assessment
Severity levels:
- low (recoverable),
- medium (requires fallback),
- high (requires escalation),
- critical (requires immediate termination).

### 4. Mitigation Strategy Selection
Depending on severity:
- regenerate LLM output,
- modify or cancel tool call,
- reset planner state,
- clear unsafe memory,
- trigger fallback response.

### 5. Execution of Mitigation
The agent applies the selected strategy:
- safe re‑prompting,
- safe tool fallback,
- session reset,
- error message generation.

### 6. Logging and Trace Update
The event is recorded in:
- reasoning trace,
- safety logs,
- system metrics.

### 7. User‑Facing Response
The agent produces a safe, policy‑compliant response without exposing internal details.

## Mitigation Strategies

### Regeneration
Used when:
- LLM output violates schema,
- unsafe content is detected.

### Fallback Response
Used when:
- regeneration repeatedly fails,
- planner cannot recover.

### Tool Call Cancellation
Used when:
- tool arguments are unsafe,
- tool is not allowed in context.

### Planner Reset
Used when:
- plan is invalid or unsafe,
- recursive loops are detected.

### Memory Sanitization
Used when:
- unsafe memory is retrieved,
- memory poisoning is detected.

---

## Design Principles

### Safety First
Unsafe content is intercepted before reaching the user.

### Deterministic Handling
The same event always triggers the same mitigation path.

### Minimal Exposure
User-facing responses never reveal internal errors or chain‑of‑thought.

### Extensibility
New safety rules or event types can be added without modifying core logic.

### Observability
All safety events are logged for debugging and analysis.

## Future Extensions

- ML‑based safety event prediction,
- adaptive mitigation strategies,
- cross‑agent safety coordination,
- real‑time safety dashboards,
- automated safety regression testing.
