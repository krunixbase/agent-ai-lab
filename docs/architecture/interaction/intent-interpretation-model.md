# Intent Interpretation Model

## Overview

The intent interpretation model determines what the user is asking, what constraints apply, and how the agent should respond. It integrates contextual signals, memory, and safety rules to derive a precise understanding of user intent.

---

## Types of Intent

### Direct Intent
Clear commands or requests.

### Implicit Intent
Requests inferred from context or phrasing.

### Exploratory Intent
Open-ended questions or brainstorming.

### Diagnostic Intent
Problem descriptions requiring clarification.

### Meta Intent
Requests about the conversation itself.

---

## Interpretation Signals

- linguistic cues,
- conversation history,
- user preferences,
- memory retrieval,
- safety constraints,
- ambiguity detection.

---

## Interpretation Pipeline

1. Parse user message.  
2. Identify intent category.  
3. Extract constraints and parameters.  
4. Retrieve relevant context from memory.  
5. Validate against safety rules.  
6. Produce structured intent representation.

---

## Ambiguity Handling

- detect missing parameters,
- detect conflicting instructions,
- detect unclear goals,
- trigger clarification strategy when needed.

---

## Integration with Other Systems

- planning uses intent to structure responses,
- memory uses intent to determine relevance,
- safety uses intent to evaluate risk.

---

## Design Principles

- precision,
- safety,
- contextual awareness,
- determinism,
- interpretability.

---

## Future Extensions

- probabilistic intent scoring,
- multi-intent disambiguation,
- long-horizon intent linking.
