# Memory Safety Model

## Overview

The memory safety model defines how the agent stores, retrieves, filters, and protects information across all memory subsystems. Its purpose is to ensure that memory operations are safe, privacy‑aware, and free from harmful or unintended side effects. The model prevents unsafe content from being stored, avoids leaking sensitive information, and ensures that memory retrieval does not introduce harmful or invalid context into prompts or planner decisions.

Memory safety applies to episodic memory, vector memory, summary memory, and persistent memory.

## Safety Objectives

- Prevent storage of sensitive or private user data unless explicitly allowed.
- Avoid reintroducing unsafe or harmful content into prompts.
- Ensure memory retrieval returns only validated, safe entries.
- Protect against memory poisoning, hallucinations, and unsafe tool outputs.
- Maintain integrity and consistency across memory layers.

## Memory Safety Layers

### Input Sanitization Layer
Before storing any memory entry, the agent:
- removes unsafe content,
- filters sensitive personal data,
- strips harmful or policy‑violating text,
- validates structural correctness.

Only sanitized entries are allowed into memory.

### Storage Safety Layer
Memory entries are stored with:
- metadata (timestamps, source type),
- safety classification tags,
- retention rules.

Unsafe or ambiguous entries are rejected or downgraded.

### Retrieval Safety Layer
When retrieving memory, the agent:
- filters out unsafe entries,
- excludes sensitive or private data,
- removes outdated or irrelevant content,
- validates entries before injecting them into prompts.

### Summarization Safety Layer
Summaries are generated using:
- sanitized memory only,
- safety‑aware LLM prompts,
- strict validation of summary outputs.

Summaries never include sensitive or harmful content.

### Persistence Safety Layer
Persistent memory follows:
- opt‑in storage rules,
- privacy‑aware retention policies,
- encryption or secure storage (depending on backend).

## Memory Safety Flow

### 1. Candidate Entry Creation
The agent generates a memory entry from:
- user input,
- tool results,
- planner decisions,
- LLM outputs.

### 2. Sanitization
The entry is cleaned and validated:
- unsafe content removed,
- sensitive data filtered,
- structure normalized.

### 3. Safety Classification
The entry is tagged as:
- safe,
- restricted,
- discard.

### 4. Storage
Only safe entries are stored in:
- episodic memory,
- vector memory,
- summary memory (if applicable).

### 5. Retrieval
When memory is retrieved:
- unsafe entries are filtered out,
- summaries are validated,
- embeddings are checked for relevance and safety.

### 6. Prompt Injection
Only validated memory is included in prompts.

## Design Principles

### Privacy First
Memory never stores sensitive or personal data unless explicitly permitted.

### Safety by Default
Unsafe or ambiguous entries are discarded rather than stored.

### Minimal Exposure
Only the minimum necessary memory is injected into prompts.

### Integrity Preservation
Memory entries remain consistent, validated, and free from corruption.

### Extensibility
New memory types or safety rules can be added without modifying core logic.

## Future Extensions

- encrypted memory backends,
- user‑controlled memory visibility and deletion,
- automated detection of sensitive content,
- memory poisoning detection and mitigation,
- cross‑agent shared memory with safety boundaries.
