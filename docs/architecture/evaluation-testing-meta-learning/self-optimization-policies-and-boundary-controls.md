# Self‑Optimization Policies and Boundary Controls

## Purpose

Self‑Optimization Policies and Boundary Controls define the rules, limits, and safeguards that ensure meta‑learning remains safe, predictable, and aligned with governance and ethical constraints.

---

## Policy Categories

- **Safety Policies** — prevent unsafe optimization.
- **Ethical Policies** — ensure fairness and autonomy.
- **Governance Policies** — enforce oversight and accountability.
- **Operational Policies** — limit resource usage and performance impact.
- **Versioning Policies** — ensure reversible and traceable changes.

---

## Boundary Controls

- **Optimization Limits** — restrict magnitude and frequency of changes.
- **Reversibility Guarantees** — ensure all adaptations can be undone.
- **Compatibility Checks** — validate changes against system versions.
- **Isolation Controls** — sandbox high‑risk adaptations.
- **Escalation Triggers** — require human review for sensitive changes.

---

## Enforcement Workflow

1. Validate proposed adaptation against policy constraints.
2. Block unsafe or non‑compliant changes.
3. Apply approved adaptations within sandboxed boundaries.
4. Log all optimization decisions for auditing.
5. Trigger governance review when thresholds are exceeded.

---

## Safety Integration

- Safety policies override all optimization goals.
- Optimization cannot modify safety thresholds or classifiers.
- Unsafe optimization attempts are logged and escalated.

---

## Integration with Other Systems

- **Governance Architecture v2** — enforces policy compliance.
- **Safety Architecture** — validates safety boundaries.
- **Versioning Model** — tracks optimization changes.
- **Runtime Layer** — applies boundary‑controlled adaptations.

---

## Design Principles

- Optimization must remain controlled and predictable.
- Policies must be deterministic and consistently enforced.
- Boundary controls must prevent runaway self‑modification.

---

## Future Extensions

- Adaptive policy tuning.
- Multi‑agent optimization governance.
- Predictive risk scoring for optimization proposals.
