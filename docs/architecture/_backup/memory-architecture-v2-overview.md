# Memory Architecture v2 Overview

## Purpose

Memory Architecture v2 defines how the agent stores, retrieves, transforms, and protects information across interactions. It expands the original memory model with stronger safety guarantees, richer contextual reasoning, and more deterministic behavior. The goal is to ensure that memory enhances user experience without introducing safety, privacy, or consistency risks.

## Core Responsibilities

- Store relevant, safe, and policy-compliant information.
- Retrieve memory in a deterministic and context-aware manner.
- Prevent unsafe, sensitive, or restricted content from being stored.
- Consolidate memory over time to maintain coherence and reduce redundancy.
- Provide contextual signals to Planning & Reasoning.
- Support long-horizon workflows across sessions.
- Maintain strict alignment with safety and privacy policies.

## Memory Types

- **Short-Term Memory** — ephemeral context for the current conversation.
- **Long-Term Memory** — durable facts, preferences, and stable user attributes.
- **Working Memory** — temporary reasoning artifacts used during planning.
- **System Memory** — internal metadata required for orchestration and auditing.

---

## Integration with Other Systems

- **Safety Architecture** — validates all memory operations.
- **Planning & Reasoning** — consumes memory signals for context.
- **Execution Layer v2** — uses memory to inform task execution.
- **Tooling Layer v2** — prevents unsafe memory-tool interactions.

---

## Design Principles

- Safety-first memory operations.
- Deterministic retrieval and consolidation.
- Minimal and meaningful storage.
- Transparent and auditable behavior.
- Strong privacy protections.

---

## Future Extensions

- Adaptive memory retention policies.
- Domain-specific memory modules.
- Long-horizon memory reasoning across multi-session workflows.
