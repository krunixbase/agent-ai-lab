# Distributed Task Allocation and Coordination

## Purpose

Distributed Task Allocation and Coordination define how tasks are decomposed, assigned, synchronized, and executed across multiple agents. This system ensures efficient, safe, and deterministic distribution of work.

---

## Task Allocation Models

- **Centralized Allocation** — a coordinator assigns tasks to agents.
- **Decentralized Allocation** — agents negotiate task ownership.
- **Capability‑Based Allocation** — tasks assigned based on agent capabilities.
- **Load‑Balanced Allocation** — tasks distributed to optimize performance.

---

## Coordination Workflow

1. Identify task requirements and constraints.
2. Evaluate agent capabilities and availability.
3. Assign tasks using selected allocation model.
4. Synchronize task dependencies across agents.
5. Monitor progress and adjust allocation dynamically.
6. Aggregate results and update shared context.

---

## Coordination Challenges

- Conflicting goals or overlapping responsibilities.
- Inconsistent or incomplete shared context.
- Resource contention or capability mismatches.
- Safety or ethical conflicts across agents.

---

## Safety Integration

- Unsafe tasks cannot be delegated.
- Safety constraints propagate across task dependencies.
- Agents must validate tasks before accepting them.

---

## Integration with Other Systems

- **Execution Layer v2** — executes distributed tasks.
- **Planning & Reasoning Architecture** — decomposes tasks for multi‑agent execution.
- **Runtime Layer** — orchestrates distributed workflows.
- **Governance Architecture v2** — ensures accountability for task allocation.

---

## Design Principles

- Deterministic and auditable task allocation.
- Safety‑first coordination.
- Efficient and scalable distribution of work.
- Clear ownership and accountability.

---

## Future Extensions

- Market‑based task allocation.
- Multi‑agent swarm coordination.
- Predictive load balancing.
