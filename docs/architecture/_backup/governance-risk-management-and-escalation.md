# Governance Risk Management and Escalation

## Purpose

Governance Risk Management and Escalation define how risks are identified, classified, mitigated, and escalated across the agent’s lifecycle. This system ensures that safety, compliance, and operational risks are managed consistently and transparently.

---

## Risk Categories

- **Safety Risks** — harmful content, unsafe actions, boundary violations.
- **Compliance Risks** — privacy violations, regulatory misalignment.
- **Operational Risks** — reliability failures, degraded performance.
- **Security Risks** — unauthorized access, data exposure.
- **Ethical Risks** — bias, unfair treatment, lack of transparency.

---

## Risk Management Workflow

1. Identify risk through monitoring or detection.
2. Classify risk severity and likelihood.
3. Apply mitigation strategies or fallback behavior.
4. Trigger escalation when thresholds are exceeded.
5. Log risk events and mitigation actions.
6. Review and update policies based on outcomes.

## Escalation Framework

### Escalation Triggers
- Safety violations.
- Repeated operational failures.
- Policy conflicts or ambiguous decisions.
- Compliance or privacy concerns.

### Escalation Levels
- **Automated Escalation** — immediate fallback or containment.
- **Human Escalation** — reviewer intervention required.
- **System Escalation** — halt or restrict agent capabilities.

### Escalation Outcomes
- Adjusted policies or configuration.
- Restricted capabilities or environment modes.
- Incident response activation.

## Safety Integration

- Safety risks override all other risk categories.
- Escalation must preserve safety enforcement.
- Risk mitigation must never weaken safety guarantees.

---

## Integration with Other Systems

- **Safety Architecture** — provides risk classification.
- **Runtime Layer** — applies escalation actions.
- **Deployment Architecture v2** — enforces environment-level constraints.
- **Security Architecture v2** — handles security-related risks.
- **Testing & Validation Framework v2** — validates risk mitigation behavior.

---

## Design Principles

- Deterministic risk classification and escalation.
- Transparent and auditable risk management.
- Safety-first escalation hierarchy.
- Extensibility for new risk categories.

---

## Future Extensions

- Predictive risk modeling.
- Cross-environment risk correlation.
- Automated escalation tuning.
