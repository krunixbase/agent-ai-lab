# Configuration Observability and Auditing

## Purpose

Configuration Observability and Auditing provide visibility into configuration changes, policy updates, and their impact on system behavior. This system ensures transparency, traceability, and long-term reliability of configuration and policy management.

---

## Observability Components

- **Configuration Change Logs** — record updates, overrides, and version changes.
- **Policy Enforcement Logs** — document policy decisions and violations.
- **Profile and Mode Logs** — track environment and mode transitions.
- **Safety Logs** — capture blocked or unsafe configuration attempts.
- **Impact Analysis Reports** — summarize behavioral changes after configuration updates.

---

## Auditing Objectives

- Detect unsafe or unintended configuration changes.
- Ensure consistent policy enforcement across environments.
- Provide traceability for configuration-driven behavior.
- Support debugging and compliance requirements.
- Enable data-driven improvements to configuration and policy models.

---

## Auditing Pipeline

1. Collect configuration and policy events.
2. Classify events by subsystem and category.
3. Analyze patterns, anomalies, and regressions.
4. Generate structured audit reports.
5. Feed insights into configuration and policy improvements.

## Integration with Other Systems

- **Safety Architecture** — validates safety-related configuration changes.
- **Runtime Layer** — correlates configuration with runtime behavior.
- **Planning & Reasoning** — evaluates impact on reasoning quality.
- **Execution Layer v2** — correlates configuration with execution performance.
- **Memory Architecture v2** — ensures logs do not store sensitive content.

---

## Design Principles

- Transparent and structured logging.
- Strong safety and privacy compliance.
- Deterministic and reproducible configuration traces.
- Actionable insights for system evolution.

---

## Future Extensions

- Real-time configuration dashboards.
- Automated detection of configuration anomalies.
- Cross-layer correlation of configuration, reasoning, and execution events.
