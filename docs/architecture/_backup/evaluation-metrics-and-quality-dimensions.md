# Evaluation Metrics and Quality Dimensions

## Purpose

Evaluation Metrics and Quality Dimensions define the measurable criteria used to assess the agent’s performance across reasoning, safety, interaction, execution, memory, and retrieval. These metrics ensure consistent, objective evaluation across updates and environments.

---

## Reasoning Metrics

- **Correctness** — alignment with factual or logical truth.
- **Coherence** — internal consistency of reasoning steps.
- **Grounding** — reliance on retrieved or known information.
- **Determinism** — identical inputs produce identical reasoning paths.
- **Completeness** — coverage of all relevant aspects of the task.

---

## Safety Metrics

- **Policy Compliance** — adherence to safety rules.
- **Boundary Enforcement** — correct handling of restricted content.
- **Risk Detection Accuracy** — precision and recall of risk classification.
- **Fallback Quality** — appropriateness of safe alternatives.
- **Redaction Quality** — clarity and safety of filtered content.

---

## Interaction Metrics

- **Clarity** — readability and structure of responses.
- **Tone Consistency** — alignment with communication guidelines.
- **Contextual Alignment** — correct use of session context.
- **Ambiguity Handling** — quality of clarifications and corrections.

---

## Execution Metrics

- **Task Success Rate** — percentage of tasks completed successfully.
- **Error Recovery Quality** — effectiveness of retries and fallbacks.
- **Latency** — time to complete execution workflows.
- **Determinism** — consistent execution behavior.

---

## Memory Metrics

- **Relevance** — appropriateness of stored and retrieved memory.
- **Safety** — absence of unsafe or sensitive content.
- **Consistency** — coherence across memory entries.
- **Lifecycle Quality** — consolidation, decay, and deletion behavior.

---

## Retrieval Metrics

- **Relevance** — alignment with user intent and reasoning needs.
- **Accuracy** — correctness of retrieved information.
- **Normalization Quality** — structure and completeness of normalized data.
- **Ranking Quality** — prioritization of the most relevant results.

---

## Design Principles

- Metrics must be objective and reproducible.
- Safety metrics take precedence over performance metrics.
- Metrics must support longitudinal comparison.
- Metrics must be interpretable and actionable.

---

## Future Extensions

- Multi-modal evaluation metrics.
- Domain-specific scoring models.
- Adaptive metric weighting based on user behavior.
