# Performance Observability and Adaptive Tuning

## Purpose

Performance Observability and Adaptive Tuning provide visibility into system performance and enable dynamic adjustments to optimize efficiency while preserving safety and correctness.

---

## Observability Components

- **Performance Metrics** — latency, throughput, resource usage.
- **Reasoning Metrics** — depth, branching, and grounding efficiency.
- **Execution Metrics** — task duration, concurrency, and error rates.
- **Retrieval Metrics** — query latency, ranking quality, and cache hit rates.
- **Memory Metrics** — access speed, footprint, and lifecycle behavior.

---

## Adaptive Tuning

### Dynamic Adjustment Strategies
- Adjust reasoning depth based on workload.
- Modify concurrency based on resource availability.
- Tune retrieval caching based on hit/miss patterns.
- Adapt memory retention based on relevance signals.

### Safety Constraints
- Adaptive tuning must never weaken safety enforcement.
- Safety overrides all dynamic adjustments.
- Unsafe tuning suggestions are automatically rejected.

## Monitoring Pipeline

1. Collect performance metrics across subsystems.
2. Analyze patterns and detect bottlenecks.
3. Apply safe adaptive tuning rules.
4. Update runtime state with new performance parameters.
5. Log tuning decisions for auditing.

## Integration with Other Systems

- **Runtime Layer** — orchestrates adaptive tuning.
- **Safety Architecture** — validates tuning decisions.
- **Execution Layer v2** — applies tuned scheduling and concurrency.
- **Knowledge & Retrieval Architecture v2** — adjusts retrieval strategies.
- **Memory Architecture v2** — adapts memory lifecycle behavior.

---

## Design Principles

- Deterministic and safe tuning behavior.
- Transparent and auditable adjustments.
- Minimal disruption to user experience.
- Extensibility for new tuning strategies.

---

## Future Extensions

- Predictive tuning using machine-learned models.
- Cross-environment tuning coordination.
- Multi-agent performance optimization.
