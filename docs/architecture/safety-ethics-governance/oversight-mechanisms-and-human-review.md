# Oversight Mechanisms and Human Review

## Purpose

Oversight Mechanisms and Human Review define how human supervisors monitor, evaluate, and intervene in agent behavior. This system ensures that critical decisions, safety-sensitive actions, and ambiguous cases receive appropriate human oversight.

---

## Oversight Mechanisms

### Continuous Monitoring
- Track safety, compliance, and operational signals.
- Monitor reasoning, execution, and retrieval behavior.
- Detect anomalies requiring human attention.

### Human Review Triggers
- Safety violations or high-risk content.
- Policy conflicts or ambiguous decisions.
- Unexpected reasoning or execution behavior.
- User complaints or flagged interactions.

### Intervention Mechanisms
- Pause or terminate active sessions.
- Override agent decisions.
- Adjust configuration or policy parameters.
- Trigger incident response workflows.

## Human Review Workflow

1. Identify event requiring review.
2. Provide reviewer with full context, logs, and reasoning traces.
3. Collect structured human assessment.
4. Apply reviewer decisions to runtime or configuration.
5. Log review outcomes for auditing.

## Reviewer Roles

- **Safety Reviewers** — evaluate safety-critical decisions.
- **Compliance Reviewers** — validate regulatory alignment.
- **Operational Reviewers** — assess reliability and performance issues.
- **Ethical Reviewers** — evaluate fairness and transparency concerns.

---

## Safety Integration

- Human reviewers validate safety escalations.
- Safety-critical decisions require mandatory human oversight.
- Reviewer feedback informs safety policy updates.

---

## Integration with Other Systems

- **Runtime Layer** — supports intervention and overrides.
- **Safety Architecture** — provides risk classification.
- **Configuration & Policy Layer v2** — updates policies based on review.
- **Testing & Validation Framework v2** — incorporates reviewer feedback.

## Design Principles

- Human oversight must be efficient and context-rich.
- Review processes must be structured and auditable.
- Oversight must complement, not replace, automated safeguards.
- Reviewer decisions must be deterministic and consistent.

---

## Future Extensions

- Reviewer assistance tools for complex cases.
- Multi-reviewer consensus workflows.
- Domain-specific oversight modules.
